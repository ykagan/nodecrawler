Node.js Crawler and Site Map generator
===================

This console app crawls a single domain to generate a sitemap for this domain.

The sitemap is returned as a JSON object in this format:

{
	linkText: "Text of the anchor tag",
	linkUrl: "/this/url",
	assets:[
		'/assets/home.jpg',
		...
	],
	childLinks:{[
		{
			linkText:'...',
			linkUrl: '...'
		}
		....
	]}
}


Installation
-----------
	npm install

Run
-------------
	node crawler [domain] (depth)
	node crawler https://joingrouper.com 4

The depth is optional and defaults to 4

Implementation Details
---------------

We use node *async* to execute HTTP requests against the target domain (up to a maximum if 10 requests at a time to avoid DDOSing the web server).

*cheerio* handles parsing the results and extracting links. This is much more performant than a full DOM implementation like jsdom.

Requests are handled through a queue one depth level at a time, 10 requests at a time.
